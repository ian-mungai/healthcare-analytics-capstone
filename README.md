# healthcare-analytics-capstone

## Overview

Healthcare Analytics Capstone is a healthcare data engineering and analytics platform developed as the capstone project for a Master's degree program.

The project demonstrates the design and implementation of a modern cloud-based data pipeline using Apache Airflow, AWS S3, AWS Glue, SQL, and Docker. It ingests publicly available CMS hospital quality datasets, performs data transformation and curation, and produces analytics-ready datasets for reporting, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Project Objectives

- Build an automated healthcare data pipeline
- Implement a scalable cloud-based data lake architecture
- Transform and curate healthcare quality datasets
- Create analytical datasets suitable for reporting and statistical modeling
- Demonstrate end-to-end data engineering workflows

## Data Sources

The project utilizes public datasets from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), including:

- Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI)
- Hospital General Information
- HCAHPS Patient Experience Surveys
- PSI-90 Patient Safety Indicators
- Timely and Effective Care Measures

## Architecture

1. Apache Airflow orchestrates data ingestion and transformation workflows.
2. CMS datasets are extracted from public data sources.
3. Raw datasets are stored in Amazon S3.
4. AWS Glue jobs perform cleansing, transformation, and curation.
5. SQL models generate analytics and regression-ready datasets.
6. Final datasets support downstream analysis and reporting.

## Technology Stack

- Python
- Apache Airflow
- AWS S3
- AWS Glue
- SQL
- Docker
- Jupyter Notebook

## Account-Specific Configuration

This project requires local configuration for AWS and Airflow. Do not commit personal account identifiers, access keys, bucket names, or local machine paths.

Use placeholders in committed files and configure real values locally.

### Required Local Values

| Value                  | Description                                      | Example Placeholder             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| AWS region             | AWS region used for S3 and Glue                  | `AWS_REGION=your-aws-region`    |
| S3 bucket              | Destination bucket for raw and curated data      | `S3_BUCKET=your-s3-bucket-name` |
| Airflow AWS connection | Airflow connection used by S3 and Glue operators | `aws_credentials`               |

## AWS Setup Requirements

Before running the full pipeline, configure these AWS resources:

1. Create an S3 bucket for the project.
2. Create or configure AWS Glue jobs matching the job names used in the DAG:
   - `prepare_hai`
   - `prepare_hospital_characteristics`
   - `prepare_patient_experience`
   - `prepare_patient_safety`
   - `prepare_timely_effective_care`
   - `prepare_ml_dataset`
3. Upload or reference the Glue scripts from the `glue_jobs/` directory.
4. Ensure the Glue execution role has permissions for:
   - S3 read/write access
   - Glue job execution
   - CloudWatch logging
5. Configure AWS credentials locally or through an Airflow connection.

## Airflow AWS Connection

The DAG expects an Airflow connection named:

```text
aws_credentials
```

Create it in the Airflow UI:

1. Open Airflow at `http://localhost:8080`.
2. Go to **Admin > Connections**.
3. Add a new connection.
4. Use the following values:
   - Connection Id: `aws_credentials`
   - Connection Type: `Amazon Web Services`
   - AWS Access Key ID: your local AWS access key, if not using an IAM role
   - AWS Secret Access Key: your local AWS secret key, if not using an IAM role
   - Region Name: your AWS region

Do not commit AWS credentials to the repository.
